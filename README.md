A repository of correct and incorrect automata in [HOA format](http://adl.github.io/hoaf/).

You can find the latest version of this repository at https://github.com/adl/hoaf-tests/

## Overview

This collection of automata in the HOA format is intended to provide
 * examples of the various features of the HOA format
 * examples of corner-cases in the format
 * automata that are invalid in specific ways to enabled testing of parsers
 
One aim is to serve as a test suite for HOAF parsers.

## Structure

The automata/ sub-directory contains a variety of automata.

## Automata annotations

To allow for the automated testing of HOAF parsers and manipulation tools,
the automata can be annotated:
